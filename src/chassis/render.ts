// The chassis's component-grammar wiring: a theme supplies its own icon set (the concrete glyph
// data) and its own defineComponent() list; this module wires either into the engine's render
// helpers with no theme-specific knowledge of its own. A theme reads makeIconRenderer, never
// iconSpan/glyph directly, so re-skinning the icon SET (swapping the glyph data passed in) never
// touches a component's build() function. Copied verbatim from cairn-cms's showcase per the
// chassis's own subtractability rule (src/chassis/README.md): Task 1's scaffold omitted this file
// since zero components were registered at scaffold time; Task 3 re-adds it now that the club
// content's migrated directives (passage, callout, cards/card) need real icons. It also holds the
// prose-typography seam: a createRenderer remarkPlugins entry a theme composes in once, so every
// render call inherits it.

 * so inline code, fenced code blocks, and link URLs (held as node attributes, never as text) are
 * structurally exempt, and already-curly input passes through unchanged (it only rewrites
 * straight ASCII marks). A theme wires it once through
 * `createRenderer(registry, { remarkPlugins: proseTypography })`; both the public render and the
 * editor's live preview read the one `renderMarkdown` that composes, so both inherit it.
